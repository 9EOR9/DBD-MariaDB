- update tests to use get_info(SQL_IDENTIFIER_QUOTE_CHAR) for quoting 
  (when s///ing  suff out or update tests to use quoted names).
x use DBD::ODBC & its type_info_all() to test type_info_all in DBD::mysql
- write test scripts for quote_idenitifer();
- add tests for autoreconnect (dev only -- since these will require restarting 
  mysqld ?)
+ Document compile time options to change found_rows behaviour
+ Document compile time option for SSL: 'perl Makefile.PL -ssl' 
  is not documented
- dbd_login6 with attrib (maybe)
- f_key_info() func & tests.
+ update type_info_all.
- Warnings when invalid GetTypeInfo type is passed into get_type_info;
- make tests should test all mysql column types for native2sql() -- or better
  yet have native2sql be generated by a script that also generates the types
  table.

- Test change to client_flag = 0 || CLIENT_FOUND_ROWS placement.
- Write up test for found_rows = 1 
- execute & al. should also key found row if the user wants CLIENT_FOUND_ROWS.

- Instead of ifdefing full sections of mysql_dr_connect allow the hv_fetch
  but warn when setting the attribute that support for it is not compiled it.
- test re-execute of partially fetched() statement with & w/o finish()
- Look at mem leak in autoreconnects. -- When auto recconect works, we thow
  away the pointer to save_socket w/o freeing it.
- list_fieds needs to be added readded to execute() -- maybe;
- PramValues
- Embedded mysql server.  make embedded => (DBD::mysqlEmbed? || DBD::SQLHeavy :)
- Add tests for when autocommit is not supported
- Tests for change to rollback behaviour where DESTROY calls mysql_db_rollback.
- what is the return -2 for? Also look at making do_error return a false value
  so that one can 'return do_error(...)'.
- remove dbd_mysql_coomit and make the commit called from the hash key set
  use mysq_db_commit.
- remove goto hackary... Finish cleaning up connect
- tests for $sth->{ParamValues}
